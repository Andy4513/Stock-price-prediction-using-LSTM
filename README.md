# Stock price prediction LSTM
 
The goal of this project is to predict opening prices for the S&P500 index. For this, we will gather the data from yahoo finance, use an ARIMA model to have a benchmark, filter the data and use a LSTM model to predict the stock prices.

The project has 4 parts as follows:

### Part 1

Data gathering 

### Part 2

Analyse the data and create an ARIMA model for stock prediction.

### Part 3

Create a filter and filter the data

### Part 4

Use LSTM models trained on data to predict stock prices.
